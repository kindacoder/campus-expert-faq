                                    <b>Answer:</b>  Great question. By being at school, you already have a community. There's a group of people together in one place studying towards a particular goal. That's a community! But that community might not look like the one you would like to create: it's that difference that you should focus on :) How do you move from that vague gathering of students, to an actual community?

                                    <b>Answer:</b>  Hi @0ly! This is a pretty common question, I'm happy to help out. When we refer to community, we're talking about the community you already belong to at your university. We're not referring to an organized group, but whatever group you identify with and would like to use your platform as a Campus Expert to help. For example, my community identified in training was "engineering students at my university interested in robotics and software development". This community doesn't mean a club or a class or a department, but the overall group of students you have a passion for helping! I hope this helps

                                    <b>Answer:</b>  Hey Gattal, so to explain it better this is what I thought of the question: the words that are important in that question are "facilitated" and "needs facilitated". Which pretty much means how we are going to make something easy or available. So yes you are right by definition it could be blackboards and permission to use classroom etc. But it could also be about people, eg accessibility requirements, or if you are ordering pizza for a club meeting then making sure dietary requirements are fulfilled (as that is making sure personal needs are facilitated). That is what I focused around for my submission anyways, hope that helps

Check out foam board - it's cheap and easy to print, but can also be made quite large, so it's a good fit for temporary signage that may change over time.

                                    <b>Answer:</b>   Foam board or Foam core board is a strong and lightweight material that is easily cut with a sharp craft knife or picture framing mat cutter.


It is commonly used for the mounting of prints and photographs and as backing in picture frames.


Foamboard is easily formed into shapes that can be used for interior design and architectural models.

                                    <b>Answer:</b>   Hi @muskan-jhunjhunwalla, it probably helps by breaking down the words and getting a understanding of what they mean. So for example "inclusive" means including something or someone, and "marginalised" means something that is not the majority (I always thought of it like A4 page margins, the body of the A4 paper is majority, and everything around the A4 body is margins). So to put it bluntly, the question ends up asking what are some of the things that could happen that can stop you from including people that aren't the majority.

As Joe said above "scenarios you should address are those that might affect under-represented groups in your community. This is what the module refers to as marginalised groups." Not to give away the answer but have a think around the topics such as women in tech, accessibility/disability, etc. Hope that helps

                                    <b>Answer:</b>  They're more 'inclusion needs'. What needs can you facilitate? For example - it might be easy to move to a space that's wheelchair accessible. THis would mean that you can meet the needs of those who use wheelchairs.

You can also meet dietary needs by collecting requirements ahead of time and properly labelling foods.

Wheras you might not be able to facilitate the needs of (for example) a hard of hearing participant because your workshops are delivered without captioning or written notes. Your resourcing might not make this possible.

Being aware of what you can and cannot achieve is key, and that's why we ask there questions.
